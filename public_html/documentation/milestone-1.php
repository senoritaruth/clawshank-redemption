<h2>Persona</h2>
<p>Name: Cecy</p>
<p>Description: Cecy is my niece. As an avid cat-lover, she enjoys spending time with my two cats. Unfortunately, she doesn't get to do so as much as she would like. She's about to start high school. She's a very skilled novice user of the internet, and uses various apps and websites to post her photos and music. I hope she will visit the Clawshank Redemption site any time she's feeling stressed and needs to have a laugh and feel happy.</p>
<p>Goals: I hope to share the story of Greyson and Cally to spread a bit of cheer and practice my storytelling skills.</p>
<p>Frustrations: Cecy faces a lot of challenges in life, and often finds solace online. She's very often isolated and feels misunderstood.</p>
