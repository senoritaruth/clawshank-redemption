		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p>A brief introduction of the cats, and a teaser as to why this site is called Clawshank Redemption. I will include a picture of both of them. </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Pictures</h2>
		<p>The main feature of the website will be photos of the cats. I will be putting together a gallery of their best adventures from their first year together. These will include embeds from Instagram as well as never-before published shots taken around the house. I will also illustrate how the great escape happened.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>The rest of the story</h2>
		<p>Why do we call the cats Clawshank Redemption? This is the part of the webpage where we find out how Cally has changed her older brother from a retiring gentleman to a spry guy with a second lease on life.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Social Media</h2>
		<p>Every modern cat has social media! You'll be able to follow their adventures on Twitter and Instagram via the social media links.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Contact form</h2>
		<p>Do you have treats for Cally and Greyson? You can definitely contact them!</p>
