## Milestone 1 Feedback
Purpose, Audience, and Goal are clear and concise. I understand your intention for this site but also keep in mind for future projects to have a little more detail in these sections. It will help define who you're trying to reach with a website. The persona you created could also have more detail. Nonetheless, these are all sufficient in moving forward into Milestone 2α.

Your project and files are all set up to spec. Your code may need some clean up. There seems to be some nesting issues. Refer to the DOM via Google images for visual examples. Remember, there are parent, children, and siblings when nesting your HTML elements

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier III. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2α.
